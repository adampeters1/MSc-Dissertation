Many people struggle to make peace with the fact that while they were top of their class in high school but are now just average at a place like Penn or MIT or Cornell. Also the workload and the pressure to have it together and achieve at such a high level can be a lot to handle on top of all the issues every young adult faces.  At least for me what helped at Penn was the ability to have a great social circle through the many extracurricular activities, clubs, organizations offered on campus and the ability to escape from campus into Philly from time to time. There are people who prefer a smaller, less high-octane environment where they can be a bit more coddled and eased into the whole college experience. There is no shame in being one of these people but places like Penn, Cornell, MIT, Columbia are probably not the right choices for these people.  I just think you need to have a sense of who you are and what environment fits you best.   \n","\n","       university  \n","444617    Cornell  \n","444618    Cornell  \n","444619        MIT  \n","444620  Princeton  \n","444621   Columbia  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2f49d1af-34b2-4225-9955-728f1c53647d\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>content</th>\n","      <th>university</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>444617</th>\n","      <td>and why did Cornell have to put up nets under its bridges ?</td>\n","      <td>Cornell</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>444618</th>\n","      <td>Because Cornell has lots of bridges.</td>\n","      <td>Cornell</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>444619</th>\n","      <td>When a lifelong friend of my brother was an undergrad at Cornell, he invited my brother to be a guest at his fraternity house and attend a themed fraternity party.
